THIS IS SIMPLE WEBAPP IN WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AS A REGISTRATION PAGE FOR OUR ROBOTICS CLUB AT NIT PATNA.
I HAVE USED HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQURERY FOR FRONTEND AND FIREBASE FOR DATABASE.

THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS WEBAPP IS THAT IT CONTAINS 36 OPTIONS AND ONCE A USER SELECTS ONE OF THE OPTIONS IT GETS DISAPPEARED.
THUS IN THIS WAY EVERY USER GETS A UNIQUE PROBLEM STATEMENT.
